A collection of scripts, configs, and utilities for infrastructure, blockchain tooling, and general development.

This monorepo consolidates multiple smaller repositories into a single, organized structure for easier maintenance and discovery.

## Structure

- `infrastructure/`: Contains scripts and configurations for managing infrastructure.
- `blockchain/`: Tools and scripts related to blockchain development and management.
- `utils/`: General utilities and helper scripts for various tasks.
- `edge/`: Edge and serverless computing related scripts and configurations.
- `labs/`: Experimental scripts and configurations for testing new ideas and technologies.

## Goals

- Reduce the number of repositories
- Reduce fragmentation between related tooling
- Preserve full commit history from original repositories
- Make it easier to share workflows, CI, and documentation
- Improve discoverability of scripts and configurations
